## Key Features Implementation

### Text-to-Speech Integration

The app uses Android's built-in TextToSpeech API to provide audio feedback:

- Numbers are announced when pressed
- Operations are spoken ("plus", "minus", "times", "divided by")
- Results are read aloud
- Speech rate is adjusted for children (slower pace)

### Child-Friendly UI

- **Large Buttons**: 32sp text size with generous padding
- **High Contrast**: Bright colors for easy visibility
- **Grid Layout**: Organized button arrangement
- **Visual Feedback**: Different colors for different button types

### Calculator Logic

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, Ã—, Ã·)
- Error handling (division by zero)
- Result formatting (integers vs decimals)
- Clear functionality

## Installation

1. Download the APK from the GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" on your Android device
3. Install the APK file
4. Grant microphone permissions if prompted (for TTS)

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Tap number buttons to input numbers (app will speak each number)
3. Tap operation buttons for math operations
4. Press equals (=) to calculate result
5. Use clear (C) to reset the calculator

## Development

### Adding New Features

The app is designed to be easily extensible:

- Add new operations in `MainActivity.kt`
- Modify UI in `activity_main.xml`
- Update colors and themes in `res/values/`

### Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
./gradlew test
```
